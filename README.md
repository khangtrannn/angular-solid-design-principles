What is design principle?
- Recommendations how to design your code such a way in order to keep it maintainable, flexible and so on...

Design Patterns like strategy, factory, etc... which implement design principles

Single responsibility
- A class should have one, and only one, reason to change which means that some component or class or module should do only one thing but do it well

Open/Closed Principle
- Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification
- It means that on the rife you should design your classes, modules, and even libraries such a way that you should extend it functionality wihtout touching the component

Liskov Substitution Principle
- Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it

Interface segregation service
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
